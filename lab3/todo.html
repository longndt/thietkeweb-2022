      <p style="text-align: justify">Developing writers can often benefit from examining an essay, a paragraph, or even
         a sentence to determine what
         makes it
         effective. On the following pages are several paragraphs for you to evaluate on your own, along with the
         Writing
         Center's explanation.

         Note: These passages are excerpted from actual student papers and retain the original wording. Some of the
         sentences are
         imperfect, but we have chosen these passages to highlight areas in which the author was successful.
